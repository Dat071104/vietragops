# Agent Ops Index / Muc luc bo nho

Router for this folder. Read this first when you do not know which memory file
you need. Load files in tier order and stop as soon as you can act -- reading
everything here defeats the purpose of the folder.

## Read Order

| Tier | File | Read when | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `SESSION_BRIEF.md` | Every managed session. Goal, constraints, current state. | Light |
| 0 | `OPERATING_RULES.md` | Every managed session. Behavior and safety rules. | Light |
| 0 | `CURRENT_TASK.md` | A task is already in progress. Files touched, dead ends, next step. | Light |
| 0 | `HANDOFF.md` | **A previous session handed off.** Read it before anything else when its Status is `open`. | Light |
| 1 | `REPO_MAP.md` | You need to locate code or judge blast radius. **Read before grepping the repo.** | Light |
| 1 | `code_index.json` | Never read directly -- it is machine-sized. Query it with `tools/explore.py`. | n/a |
| 1 | `LOG_SUMMARY.md` | You need recent history without the full log. | Light |
| 2 | `PROJECT_CONTEXT_CARD.md` | Durable project facts: stack, architecture, business rules, run/test commands. | Medium |
| 2 | `PHASE_ROADMAP.md` | Planning or checking phase order and gates. | Medium |
| 2 | `DECISION_LOG.md` | A past trade-off is relevant to the current choice. | Medium |
| 2 | `RISK_REGISTER.md` | Assessing or adding risk. | Medium |
| 2 | `THIRD_PARTY_TOOLING.md` | Using or updating prepared MarkItDown/Firecrawl checkouts. | Light |
| 2 | `env_templates/README.md` | Handling local app or Firecrawl environment files. | Light |
| 3 | `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` | `LOG_SUMMARY.md` was not enough. Append-only history; tracked, so it survives a clone. | Heavy |
| 3 | `phase_context_cards/` | Working inside one specific phase; for Evolve read its tracker then the active gate only. | Medium |
| 3 | `archive/` | Investigating something older than the retained log window. | Heavy |
| ref | `SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` | Changing session behavior, or unsure about the closure gate. | Medium |
| ref | `tools/` | The scripts below. Copies of the workspace pack, so this project runs them with no pack installed. Do not hand-edit. | n/a |

## Write Triggers

| Event | Update |
| --- | --- |
| Each meaningful step in a task | `CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| Every managed session | `SESSION_BRIEF.md` (state, next step, `Last Verified Commit`) |
| Real implementation, test, or audit evidence | append `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` |
| Durable project or milestone state changed | `PROJECT_CONTEXT_CARD.md` |
| Decision with material trade-offs | `DECISION_LOG.md` |
| New or changed material risk | `RISK_REGISTER.md` |
| Code files moved or added | rebuild `code_index.json`, then regenerate `REPO_MAP.md` |
| Ending a session that another session will continue | `HANDOFF.md` via `handoff-team/` |
| Absorbing a handoff at session start | set `HANDOFF.md` Status to `consumed` |

The root agent owns every file here. Subagents never write to this folder.
Before reporting a task complete, print the Closure Receipt defined in
`SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Git Tracking (hybrid policy)

Enforced by `_agent_ops/.gitignore`.

| Tracked -- durable memory, should survive a clone | Ignored -- session scratch, machine-local |
| --- | --- |
| `INDEX.md`, `OPERATING_RULES.md`, `SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT_CARD.md`, `REPO_MAP.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`, `archive/`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `PHASE_ROADMAP.md`, `phase_context_cards/`, `tools/` | `SESSION_BRIEF.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, `LOG_SUMMARY.md`, `code_index.json`, `__pycache__/` |

`tools/` is tracked on purpose: a teammate who clones this project then has
working tooling without installing the workspace pack. `code_index.json` is
not -- it is rebuilt from source, can reach tens of MB, and would conflict on
every merge.

Tracked files are visible to anyone who can read the repository. Never put
secrets, private data, or unverified claims in any file here.

## Helper Scripts

Run from the project root. These live in `_agent_ops/tools/`, so they work with
no workspace pack installed.

```bash
python _agent_ops/tools/session_start.py --root .                     # read-only session checks
python _agent_ops/tools/generate_repo_map.py --root . \
    --output _agent_ops/REPO_MAP.md --force                  # refresh the code map
python _agent_ops/tools/build_code_index.py --root .                  # rebuild the symbol graph
python _agent_ops/tools/explore.py --symbol <name>                    # callers, callees, flow
python _agent_ops/tools/explore.py --impact <name>                    # blast radius + tests
python _agent_ops/tools/scan_deps.py --root . --seed "<keyword>" --hops 2   # file-level zone
python _agent_ops/tools/summarize_implementation_log.py \
    --log _agent_ops/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md --rotate --keep 10 \
    --output _agent_ops/LOG_SUMMARY.md --force               # summarize + archive
```

If Python is unavailable, every one of these has a manual fallback described in
`SESSION_PROTOCOL.md`.
